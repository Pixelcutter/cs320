# Cool Cams
Hello! This repository is a group project for the CS 320 class at Washington State University Vancouver campus. There are 4 memebers: 
**Garett Loghry**, **Julion Oddy**, **Peter**, and **Levicy Radeleff**. In this term project is supposed to be a display of "Cool Cams" or interesting projects that catch the users eye. Each member has their own distict, though related, Cool Cam. Our Cool Cams are D&D related. Each member will have their own section here for what they worked on and contributed to the project, please see below. The project was started on January 17th 2022 as part of the Spring Semester.

Description:  
&nbsp;My Cool Cam is a GUI that will (hopefully) link all of our Cool Cams togther! It is made with Python using the pygame library. Pygame is an excellent Free and Open Source Python library typically used in game development. I work in the pycharm IDE and will make system calls to Julion and Levicy's Cool Cams (see below!)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;TO RUN:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make garett  
&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An asset is included in the repo. Can be removed if cumbersome. The Assets/ dir is mine also
