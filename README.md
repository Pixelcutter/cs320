# Cool Cams
Hello! This repository is a group project for the CS 320 class at Washington State University Vancouver campus. There are 5 memebers: 
**Garett Loghry**, **Julion Oddy**, **Peter**, **Jared Diamond**, and **Levicy Radeleff**. In this term project is supposed to be a display of "Cool Cams" or interesting projects that catch the users eye. Each member has their own distict, though related, Cool Cam. Our Cool Cams are D&D related. Each member will have their own section here for what they worked on and contributed to the project, please see below. The project was started on January 17th 2022 as part of the Spring Semester.

## Garett
Name: Garett Loghry  
Contact: garett.loghry@wsu.edu  
Description:  
My Cool Cam is a GUI that will (hopefully) link all of our Cool Cams togther! It is made with Python using the pygame library. Pygame is an excellent Free and Open Source Python library typically used in game development. I work in the pycharm IDE and will make system calls to Julion and Levicy's Cool Cams (see below!)  

> TO RUN:  
make garett

> NOTE:  
An asset image is included in the repo. Can be removed if cumbersome. The gui/ dir is mine and all of its
> sub directories belong to this project.

See the [README](https://github.com/gloghry/cs320/tree/master/gui) in the gui/ directory for a more 
    in depth explanation of what my project is.

## Julion
Name: Julion Oddy  
Contact: julion.oddy@wsu.edu  
Description: Character Generator and Creator. The program/tool will pull from a .txt database and place created character in a new, seperate, .txt file. Random effects so far are Stats, Class, and Race. Planning on Archetypes, Stat allocation to better stats per class, and editing.

## Levicy
Name: Levicy Radeleff  
Contact: levicy.radeleff@wsu.edu  
Description: Map creation tool. The program pulls from several .txt files to build a random map, which includes colors signifying biomes and up to 6 features. Each feature has  a description. The map is clickable, and by clicking on a hexbox the user can see the information on a specific hex.   

## Peter
Name: Peter Wanner  
Contact: peter.wanner@wsu.edu  
Description: The goal with this item database system was to create a database system from scratch using python. It should eventualy have the ability to support multiple inventory systems as well. The end goal was to create a database in which you can add, delete, and edit items. All public methods of the itemDB class should return a python dict/json format. And it should start with a success flag, resulting in true if it succeded or false otherwise. It it results in false it should then have a reason flag which you can query for why it failed.

## Jared
Name: Jared Diamond  
Contact: jared.diamond@wsu.edu  
Description: The goal of the lore builder is to give users the ability to easily develop lore for their characters / campaigns by offering a list of relevant suggestions based on prompts, or simply letting them enter custom information. For example, a user has created a new bard character. When this new character is input into the lore builder program, the user will be provided a list of relevant facts about bards, such as famous bards, bard colleges, and common instruments. With this information, the user can then be inspired (or not) to add interesting tidbits about their characters that they did not know existed before using the lore builder. The lore builder will go beyond characters though, as it will also allow campaign creators the ability to search for relevant information on their campaign settings. Overall, the lore builder will function as more of a 5E lore explorer, a source of inspiration for character or campaign lore creation. All searchable data came from the [Forgotten Realms Fandom Wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).
See the [README](https://github.com/gloghry/cs320/tree/master/lore_searcher) in the lore_searcher directory for instructions on how to run it.
