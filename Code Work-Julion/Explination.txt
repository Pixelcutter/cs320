In very short and simple terms...

Character Generator will work with:
*Stats
*Race
*Class
*Background
*Level (Optional, otherwise, Lvl 1 always)

As the main randomization points. You can choose to Randomize, Recomend, or Select the next section; along with
choosing the starting location of this (If you have a specific character design, but want to randomize others sections).

Stats:
4d6 Drop Low
Point Buy
Standard Array
??? more ???

Races:
Show Race Name, Small blurb, and Stat increases

Class:
Show Class Name, Small Blurb, Main Stats needed

Background:
Show BG Name, Small Blurb, Extra feature/skill

All code for the Random Character Generator will be pulling from in-directory file(s) to go into more detail of the stuff.
